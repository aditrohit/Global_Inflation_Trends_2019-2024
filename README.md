This project visualizes global inflation trends from 2019 to 2024 using data from the World Bank. It focuses on major economies to illustrate how inflation rates have evolved due to recent global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions. The project uses R and the wbstats package to fetch data programmatically and creates clear visualizations—line plots and heatmaps—using ggplot2 to help users easily understand inflation dynamics across countries and years.
